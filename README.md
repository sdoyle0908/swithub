# Advanced CSS Challenge: Professional Portfolio

For this challenge we were given an assignment to build a web application from scratch. By applying the core skills I've recently learned such as flexbox, media queries and CSS variables I was able to build a Portfolio in which I can use to showcase my skills and talents.

## Screenshot Description
